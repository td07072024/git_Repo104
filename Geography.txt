Gomukh is 18 km from Gangotri in the foothills of Bhagirathi at a height of 4,023 m. It is the snout of the Gangotri Glacier.

Around the snout, nature presents a wild topography. There are boulders scattered here and there with some pieces of broken snow, along with the hard clayey snow of the glacier.[4]

The Gomukh snout is rapidly moving backwards. According to the modern research the snout has moved 1 km in just 70 years.
