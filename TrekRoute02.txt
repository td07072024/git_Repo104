The route after 'Bhojbasa' can be quite difficult, more so since the 2013 floods. One has to cross a boulder zone to reach the Gomukh snout.

The trek beyond Gomukh is quite difficult. Crossing the glacier and going towards Tapovan has become quite dangerous nowadays because of the landslides. There is no track and one must have a guide and should be prepared to face any type of accident which can even be a life-threatening one. The last climb to reach Tapovan is very stiff, within 2 km a climb of around 1500 foot and is quite a challenging experience.

You may apply for an online permit,[7] even with an online permit you would still need to get it verified at the district magistrate uttrakasi office.
